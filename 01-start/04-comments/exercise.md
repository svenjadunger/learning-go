# Comments

The Go compiler ignores all text inside comments.

Go uses two types of comments:

```go
// This is a single-line comment
```

```go
/*
    This is a
    multi-line comment
*/
```

Use comments to document the code or describe *why* something happens.

## Exercise

File: `01-start/04-comments/main.go`

Sometimes, we also use comments to skip a line of code temporarily.
We say we "comment something out".

Comment out one of the lines so that the program displays:

```bash
I <3 Go!
```
