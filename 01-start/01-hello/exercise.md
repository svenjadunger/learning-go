# Hello, World!

Welcome on board! Let's get you started and familiar with this training.

First, open the `01-start/01-hello/main.go` file from your training directory.

Don't worry if you don't understand all of it yet. We'll discuss the details soon.

For now, look for the line with a double-quoted `"Hello"`:

```go
fmt.Println("Hello")
```

This line prints the text `Hello` on the screen (in the terminal). The program then exits.

## Exercise

File: `01-start/01-hello/main.go`

Change the text to say `Hello, World!`. Remember to keep it within the double quotes.
