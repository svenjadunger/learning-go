# The "ls" Project: "-l"

*This exercise continues your previous "ls" project. You will work on the same files.*

## Exercise

File: `project-ls/main.go`

Change the implementation to print each file in a separate line, similarly to how the `ls -l` command works.

Use a `for` loop over the result from `listFiles` and call `fmt.Println()` for each file.
