# Constants

If you replace the `var` keyword with `const`, you declare a **constant**.
Constants can't have their value changed once assigned.

```go
// This won't ever change
const yearOfBirth = 2022
```

## Exercise

File: `02-variables-1/03-const/main.go`

Change the `var` declaration to `const` so that it's not possible to change the hours in a day.

Remove or comment out the incorrect line, so the program compiles.
